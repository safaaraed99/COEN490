I_PROPI (uA) = (I_LS1 + I_LS2) (A) * A_IPROPI (uA/A)
    - I_PROPI = Value in current-sense resistor
    - I_LSx = Value in low side MOSFETs of H-bridge
    - A_IPROPI = Current sensing gain (typically 1k uA/A)

V_IPROPI (V) = I_PROPI (uA) * R_IPROPI (Ohm)
    - V_IPROPI = Value measured in ADC, voltage across R_IPROPI
    - Assume:
        1. V_IPROPI should range from 0 to 5V
        2. I_LS1 + I_LS2 should range from 0 to 1.5A
    - Then:
        1. I_PROPI ranges from 0 to 1500 uA
        2. R_IPROPI ~= 3.33 kOhm

I_TRIP (A) * A_IPROPI (uA/A) = V_VREF (V) / R_IPROPI (Ohm)
    - I_TRIP = Max current allowed by current regulator
    - V_VREF = Voltage on VREF input pin
    - Note that RHS = I_PROPI
    - Disable current regulation without disabling current regulation by setting V_VREF and R_IPROPI s.t. I_TRIP is never reached

Things to verify:
    1. Okay to use whole range of ADC and assume current will never exceed 1.5A? Or should sacrifice accuracy for safety margin?
    2. What value for bulk capacitance?
